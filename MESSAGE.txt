A little bit about me
I am a coding instructor for The Coder School (Cerritos location) 
I code every single day; after talking to a mentor he reccomended I allow Git Hub reflect my activity. 
From now on I will be showing my activity through Git Hub, a lot of my previous projects will be posted here and all future projects can also be found here

This Tic-Tac-Toe game is the first single-player version I have created, a student challenged me by asking if that was something we could do and this is 
what I came up with. Hope you enjoy and please let me criticize if needed, Thank you!
